# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System-Final-Project
In this project, I predicted heart disease using Machine Learning. After importing and analyzing data with plots, I generated dummy variables for categorical features and scaled others. I applied four algorithms, including Logistic Regression, and improved scores by varying parameters. Logistic Regression achieved 0.8512 accuracy.
